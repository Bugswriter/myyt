## access youtube through api or scraping it

- It seems you get better results with `yt` script (scraping) than using the api
- that couses less effort making an api but, as always, scraping is not reliable
- `yt` was highly inspired by https://github.com/sayan01/scripts/blob/master/yt, I've only made several changes to it, check his repo!
- of couse, this doesn't replace any browser
 
## Requirements

for `dmenyt`, `myyt` and `rofyt` You need to set the variable `YT_API_KEY` to the value of the token.

See [tutorial](https://elfsight.com/blog/2016/12/how-to-get-youtube-api-key-tutorial/) on the API key if you need help, or [start directly in the console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/library?filter=category:youtube) if you are familiar with the platform.

Install the required programs: `fzf`, `dmenu`, `mpv` `jq`, `awk` and `youtube-dl`.
